	<h3>Description</h3>
	
	Reflecting on the previous week, I learned about two important themes that are linked to my future performance, especially, the chance provided by the lecturer to support me and my classmate in doing better on our research tasks the next week. In addition, I became acquainted with a topic relating to collaboration and teamwork abilities, as well as certain exercises provided by the speaker to assist us to have a better understanding of this sector. This article will show what I have learned over the last week and what I've realized during my thought process.
	
	<h3>Feeling</h3>
	
	When I initially approached this manner of conducting research, it piqued my interest, from the methods I might locate colleagues for my own team to allocating individuals to certain study objectives. I recognize that completing this project will need a lot of cooperation; also, I will need to identify a reputable source that is linked to my research topic and answers the crucial question posed in the instructions.
	
	<h3>Evaluation/Analyses</h3>
	
	My lecturer gave plenty of websites that can help students easily understand how teamwork works, and I have known the websites throughout the classes' activities that can help me find a teammate and do some behavior tests that can clearly identify the person I will work with, and I have known the websites throughout the classes' activities that can help me find a teammate and do some behavior tests that can clearly identify the person I will work with.

	In my opinion, the most important material was delivered in class, and most of it was on the ethics of producing a research report. I understand that when writing a research paper, ethics must always be considered before we submit our findings. In the past, I had no idea how to spot someone who plagiarized other people's ideas, but as I approached the Unistart process, I learned that there was a tool that had already been applied to the canvas to check if their students copied other people's ideas or not, and I believe that this is the best way to avoid plagiarism.

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	
	To summarize, the majority of the information I gained from the speaker in the previous week was relevant to my next task, which is to explore a certain gadget or technology. I honestly feel that this information will enable me to tackle this problem quickly and that these lessons will also aid me in my comprehension and future endeavors.

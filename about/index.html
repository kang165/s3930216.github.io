<h3>Description</h3>
In the previous week, I had an opportunity to approach two useful topics which can help me to enhance my presentation skills such as synthesis, paraphrase and summarize the argument when making the presentation in the future. Specifically, I have gained knowledge to build my argumentative skills to give stronger arguments as well as know how to interact with the audience better when making the presentation through all activities which the lecturer gave. The engagement I have had in class has truly helped me a lot to get familiar with my upcoming program. <space>
	
	<h3>Feeling</h3>
All the knowledge I had learned in the first day of the course was about how to use schoolâ€™s facilities to help us get better grade in our assignment and not relate to my study skills much, that why in first time get deeper into the introduction of science seems really hard to get familiar with in my opinion, all the knowledge which the lecturer gave me gave me a higher level of academic knowledge. I was afraid when my class was running online, it's easy to login and study in the early morning though, but the connection between student and lecturer seems harder to catch. However, the interaction between our classmates and lecturer went smoothly thanks to the chatbox. The lecture guide about presentation really pulled me up after a long time of not making any presentations with high-level focusing and investigation. It excited me and brought motivation to prepare for my upcoming presentation.<space>

	<h3>Evaluation/Analyses</h3>
What impressed me was that our lecturer brought knowledge continuously throughout the class. It is really exciting and peaceful while learning with only seven classmates which help me to communicate with each other easier, we combine together to finish all activities in good condition. Most successful thing I gained from this week in my perspective was that the Chunking method assisted me to get better memory. My lecturer explained and analyzed how this was going to work from the middle of the class. That gave me a huge understanding to apply this method into my study process or even my daily life.<space>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
In short, It was a great experience when I had a chance to get close to this knowledge, these topics turned out to be arguments in my life, it's extinct around me. I truly believe that this information will assist me to do a great presentation in the future.<space>

<h3>Description</h3>

Last week was a Christmas weekâ€™s holiday and we all celebrated it at home. However, I still spent time on reviewing what I had learnt from the beginning week and did research for the assigment 1 which required me to write about a techonoly. And this morning, I had an opporturnity to understand clearly  and reinforce knowledge that is necessary for my research due to the introduction of doing research topic presented by our professor Jonathan. He introduced what is research, differences in inductive and deductive reason and ethics in doing research. we were also instrucuted the most important structures requirements for a research , problem identification, quanlitative and quantitative approaches and data collection to plan a research. Finally, we were introduced to a reference management software called Mendeley which there were some functions that was essential for my work.  
<h3>Feeling</h3>

	Although I had a great week of holidays, parallel with it I did not forget to learn and do research. I thought that it was essential for spending time to review and learn new things and holidays was a chance to do it because I had more time than usual so it would be a beneficial if I use it wisely. Later, our topic I had learnt this morning will assist in building knowledge and facilitating learning due to its variety inforamtion through various means.  
<h3>Evaluation/Analyses</h3>

	Updating your work and reviewing what we learnt during the holidays maintain the ability to clarify and achieve our objectives. The action of reivewing your work will enlighten new knowledge and  Also my research assigment is reinforced and strengthened after I acquired knowledge and requirements from research topic. 	
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	In conclusion, doing research is a crucial skill because it expands your knowledge, increase your new understanding.

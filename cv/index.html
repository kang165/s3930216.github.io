<h3>Description</h3>
	After having time to relax and think about what I have learned, taking a week off for Christmas and returning to school looks rather appealing. During the Christmas break, I discovered many amazing subjects and useful facts about my present course that have been of great assistance to me in my learning process, and this topic will release all I have learned in the previous week, despite the fact that it was a vacation. This essay, in particular, provided information regarding virtual reality (VR) technology and Metaverse, a company recognized for its commitment to transform the way we communicate through technology.
	<h3>Feeling</h3>
My most important enforcement, in my opinion, was to read a lot of articles connected to my curriculum. It's not as bad as I imagine it to be while conducting research over the break. To be honest, RMIT's Christmas break appears to go longer than any other school I've ever attended; it's long enough for me to relax for half of the week and use the remainder to learn more about my subject of study. It helped to promote me and piqued my curiosity in the material presented in the essay. Furthermore, it is quite fascinating for me to have a better understanding of VR sectors.
	<h3>Evaluation/Analyses</h3>
Prior to approaching information about technology, particularly VR technology, I had no idea how it might operate and develop properly. After reading a number of trustworthy articles, I understood that we may mix a range of features and parts, such as coding and engineering, to create a finished product with a lot of function and purpose. 
	Metaverse, the firm founded by Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, was one of the most impressive things I saw. In a nutshell, Metaverse is a virtual reality-based social networking platform. When I initially discovered this, it completely changed the way I looked at technology and thought about how it could affect the world. Furthermore, with the introduction of Metaverse's piece, Metaverse knowledge helps to my comprehension.
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
In conclusion, having a vacation over Christmas week appears to be a great loot following the nerve-wracking learning process; it assists me in organizing my timetable, and it also provides me with free time to research more material and appropriate sources linked to my present course.

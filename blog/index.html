During the time at RMIT University, first thing I need to do is that I need to firgure out what requirements for a software developer and set a weekly timetable for my pathway. Everyday, I will select a language to learn, spend about 3-4 hours to practice coding, at the time, I also need to read code written by experienced developers. Beside that, finding a community of software developer and exchange our knowledge to each others. In the second year, I will start to build a project ( I do not have right now but I will think about it in the near future), this will enhace my learning skills and show that I am a potential developer. Also, I will be an internship to gain some skills and in the final year, I will graduate with my project and I can find a real job with it.

	<h3>Description</h3>
Last Tuesday, our instructor had been introduced us a new topic which was the Human Information Specification. This lecture was about how our knowledge was limited, the division between short term memory and long term memory. Then we kept up with an activity that try to remember a list of numbers. Next part was the model human processor which is a cognitive modeling method used to calculate the times it takes to perform a task, Stroop effect is how easy it is to overload human attention in a task, the attention and focus which was the ability to stay focus in things, the human perception and the blind pot which a thing could deceive your perception. On Thursday, our lecture were presented by a guest, his name is Minh, which was about advanced technologies beyond research impact. The outcome of this lecture would be the comprehensive understanding of Computer Science, Artifical Intelligence and Machine learning, high performance Computing. First, we were introduced the paradigms of science, then the concepts and applications of Computational Science. Then, our lecturer talked bout AI and machine learning and their applications. In this part, he also talked about classifying learning problems and machine learning in a nutsell. Finally, he introduced us what is High Performance Computing (HPC), the summit supercomputer, why is HPC important and how does it work. Beside that, last week, we had a few days to complete our research, we spent time on Discord to exchange and distribute the work we needed to do.
	<h3>Feelings</h3>
Last week were a busy week for me, beside all the lectures I had been comprehensive, I also had to deal with my assignment research. Although it was tough at the beginning because my part were kind of relate with other partner, so I decided to come up with another topic. I was so happy that we could submit on time. Also all the lectures I had been conveyed this week were amazing, there were some terminologies and topics I had never heard before such as Stroop effects and High Performance Computing. It made me curious about the field that I am pursuing.	
	<h3>Analysis</h3>
Each lectures include new things and they are essential for my future career. The human information specification will help you to understand different perception of humans and how our brain react with differen situation. In the future, these terms of technologies would be familiar and I need to understand clearly of these term so that I can adopt with new technologies every day.
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	Human information specification shows the limits of humanâ€™s understand about the world and how our brains react with problems and the introduction to these technologies are essential.
